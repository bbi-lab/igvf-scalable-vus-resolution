# Runs on Linux, where grDevices::cairo_pdf() links against the system
# libcairo2 package directly -- unlike the CRAN macOS build of R, which links
# cairo_pdf() against XQuartz's X11 libs. That's what makes this image able to
# produce cairo_pdf() output without installing XQuartz on the host.
#
# Base is rocker/r-ver (not rocker/tidyverse) because rocker/tidyverse's
# versioned tags (e.g. 4.4.2) are amd64-only -- no arm64 manifest -- which
# breaks `docker build` on Apple Silicon. rocker/r-ver publishes multi-arch
# manifests for the same version tags, so we install tidyverse ourselves.

# System libraries needed to build tidyverse/ggplot2's compiled deps
# (ragg, textshaping, systemfonts, xml2, curl, ssl) plus cairo (for
# grDevices::cairo_pdf) and pandoc (for rmarkdown::render() on the .Rmd
# figure scripts), plus git (reticulate::install_python() below shells out to
# git to bootstrap its managed pyenv build). cabextract +
# ttf-mscorefonts-installer provide real Arial,
# matching the scripts' `family = 'Arial'` theme settings (ggplot2 theme
# text= / element_geom()) -- the figures were designed/reviewed on macOS,
# where Arial ships as a system font, rather than a metric-compatible
# substitute like Liberation Sans.
