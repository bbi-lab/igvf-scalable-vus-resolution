# A scalable approach to resolving variants of uncertain significance

This repository contains the data-processing pipeline and figure-generation
code behind the paper *"A scalable approach to resolving variants of
uncertain significance."* It harmonizes variant-effect measurements from 91
multiplexed assays of variant effect (MAVE) datasets, maps them to genomic
coordinates, annotates them with ClinVar/gnomAD/predictor evidence, runs the
OddsPath/ACMG-AMP classification analysis described in the paper, and
generates the manuscript's main and extended data figures.

> significance.* bioRxiv (2026).
> https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.14.705848v2

The pipeline runs in three stages, each covered in its own section below:

1. [Data preparation and variant annotation](#1-data-preparation-and-variant-annotation)
2. [Data analysis / variant classification and table preparation](#2-data-analysis--variant-classification-and-table-preparation)
3. [Figure preparation](#3-figure-preparation)

All three stages run in Docker -- see
[Software Requirements](#software-requirements) below.

**Verifying your setup:** `scripts/smoke_test_variant_annotation.sh` and
`scripts/smoke_test_analysis.sh` run Stage 1 and Stage 2 end-to-end against
tiny real-data fixtures, so you can check your environment setup without a
multi-hour, multi-GB full run. See
[`docs/smoke_tests.md`](docs/smoke_tests.md).

## 1. Data preparation and variant annotation

The first stage turns curated MAVE inputs into the integrated variant-effect
dataset (Supplementary Data 1) that everything downstream reads from. It used
to be a single notebook (`notebooks/analysis/Integrated_variant_effect_dataset_pipeline.ipynb`,
now archived); that notebook has been replaced by a Dockerized pipeline built
on the sibling **[variant-annotation](https://github.com/bbi-lab/variant-annotation)**
project.

### Relation to the variant-annotation pipeline

`variant-annotation` is a general-purpose, Dockerized variant-mapping and
annotation pipeline (reverse translation, ClinVar/gnomAD/SpliceAI/ClinGen
evidence repository/VEP/MaveDB/predictor annotation) that is developed and
versioned independently of this project. This repo depends on it rather than
reimplementing it:

- `vendor/variant-annotation` is a git submodule pinned to a known-good
  commit of `variant-annotation`.
- `scripts/variant_annotation_pipeline.sh` drives that pipeline's steps
  against this project's MAVE data, interleaving a handful of this project's
  own steps (`postprocess_mavedb_functional_classifications`,
  `add_mavedb_active_calibration_columns`, `derive_score_set_urn`,
  `annotate_simplified_consequence`, `recalculate_clingen_classification`,
  `flag_variants`) between `variant-annotation`'s numbered steps.
- `scripts/run_variant_annotation_pipeline.sh` is the orchestrator you
  actually run: it stages this project's inputs, points the
  `variant-annotation` checkout at them via `VARIANT_DATA_DIR`, runs the
  pipeline, and collects the final gzipped output.

Full architecture, the submodule/override convention, and a non-obvious
`VARIANT_DATA_DIR` path-mapping subtlety are documented in
[`docs/variant_annotation_pipeline.md`](docs/variant_annotation_pipeline.md)
— read that before touching `scripts/variant_annotation_pipeline.sh` or its
wrapper scripts.

### Environmental prerequisites

- **Docker and Docker Compose** — both `variant-annotation`'s steps and this
  project's own annotation steps run as Docker containers, not directly on
  the host.
- **A `variant-annotation` checkout** — either the vendored submodule
  (`git submodule update --init vendor/variant-annotation`) or your own
  existing checkout that already has the large reference caches downloaded
  (see below), pointed to via `export VARIANT_ANNOTATION_DIR=/path/to/checkout`.
- **Poetry** (see [Software requirements](#software-requirements) below) —
  needed to build this project's own Docker image (`Dockerfile`/`compose.yaml`)
  for the steps it contributes to the pipeline.
- **A gnomAD Hail table cache**, built once per `variant-annotation`
  checkout via `scripts/run_variant_annotation_pipeline.sh --prepare-gnomad-cache`
  (can take 6-7 hours) — not needed if `VARIANT_ANNOTATION_DIR` already
  points at a checkout where this has been done.

### Data-file prerequisites

Committed to this repo (no action needed):

- `data/input/maves/cvfg_variants.0.tsv`, `data/input/maves/score_sets.tsv`,
  `data/input/maves/Supp_Data1_column_description.xlsx` — this project's own
  variant list, dataset-name mapping, and column documentation.
- `data/input/reference/MANE.GRCh38.v1.5.summary.txt.gz` — RefSeq/Ensembl
  transcript mapping.
- `data/input/predictors/AlphaMissense_hg38.tsv.gz` (+ `.tbi`),
  `data/input/predictors/revel_hg38.tsv.gz` (+ `.tbi`),
  `data/input/predictors/data_frame_missense_variants_MP2_properties.csv.gz`
  — pinned predictor score files specific to this pipeline run.
- `data/input/mave_calibration/excalibr/json/` — per-dataset exCALIBR JSON
  calibrations (see [Section 2](#2-data-analysis--variant-classification-and-table-preparation)).

Not committed — you must populate or point at these yourself:

- A `variant-annotation` checkout with the large, generic reference caches
  already downloaded: SpliceAI VCFs, dbNSFP, `clinvar_cache/`, and the
  gnomAD Hail table cache above. These are tens of GB and are deliberately
  not duplicated into this repo.
- `IGVFFI3804AVJR.csv.gz`, downloaded separately from
  https://data.igvf.org/tabular-files/IGVFFI3804AVJR/ and placed at
  `data/input/biobank/IGVFFI3804AVJR.csv.gz` — only needed later, for a
  subset of figures (see [Section 3](#3-figure-preparation)), not for this
  stage.

### Running it

```bash
git submodule update --init vendor/variant-annotation   # if using the vendored submodule
poetry install --all-extras

# One-time per variant-annotation checkout (skip if already done):
scripts/run_variant_annotation_pipeline.sh --prepare-gnomad-cache

# Full run:
scripts/run_variant_annotation_pipeline.sh
```

This produces `data/output/maves/integrated_variant_effect_dataset.tsv.gz`
(expanded, one row per DNA-level variant) and its `.condensed.tsv.gz`
sibling (one row per measurement). Pass `--step N` to (re)run a single
numbered step for debugging — see
[`docs/variant_annotation_pipeline.md`](docs/variant_annotation_pipeline.md)
for the full step list and every per-step doc it links to.

### Adding ExCALIBR evidence columns (Supplementary Data 1)

A separate, manual step folds in per-variant ExCALIBR likelihood-ratio
evidence — `excalibr_prior`, `excalibr_posterior`, `excalibr_lr_plus`,
`excalibr_points`, `excalibr_acmg_evidence_code`, `excalibr_filter_reason`,
`excalibr_clinvar_release` — onto the integrated dataset above. Publishing
the raw prior/posterior/likelihood-ratio values (not just the points ExCALIBR
resolved them to) lets anyone recompute ACMG evidence strength under a prior
probability of their own choosing, rather than being limited to the one this
pipeline's own classification used.

This step isn't part of `scripts/run_variant_annotation_pipeline.sh` because
its input — the ExCALIBR calibration run's own copy of the integrated
dataset, `data/input/maves/dataframe_with_points.csv.gz` — isn't produced
until after that pipeline run and the exCALIBR calibration step in
[Section 2](#2-data-analysis--variant-classification-and-table-preparation)
below. Once both `data/output/maves/integrated_variant_effect_dataset.tsv.gz`
(above) and `data/input/maves/dataframe_with_points.csv.gz` exist, run:

```bash
poetry run python -m src.add_excalibr_columns
```

This writes
`data/output/maves/integrated_variant_effect_dataset_with_excalibr.tsv.gz`
and copies it to `data/output/supplementary_data/Supplementary_Data_1.tsv.gz`
— the version of Supplementary Data 1 actually distributed with the paper.
See [`docs/add_excalibr_columns.md`](docs/add_excalibr_columns.md).

## 2. Data analysis / variant classification and table preparation

The second stage takes the integrated variant-effect dataset from Stage 1
and produces the manuscript's classification tables: OddsPath calibrations,
ACMG/AMP evidence-point assignment, and the final per-gene, per-predictor
classification files (Supplementary Data 5).

This stage runs as Jupyter notebooks under `notebooks/analysis/`, executed
inside Docker via the `analysis-notebooks` Compose service (same approach as
Stage 1 and the R figures) — no local Poetry/Jupyter setup needed to
reproduce results; see [Software Requirements](#software-requirements)
below only if you want to develop/debug a notebook interactively. Each notebook has a
companion `README_*.md` in the same directory documenting its inputs,
methods, and outputs in detail — read those before running or modifying
one.

Run in this order:

1. **`OddsPath_calculations.ipynb`** — OddsPath likelihood-ratio
   calculations per dataset, following Brnich et al. (2019).
2. **`src/load_oddspath_calibrations.py`** — loads that notebook's output
   (`data/output/mave_calibration/OddsPath_calibrations.csv.gz`) into the
   `OddsPath_calibrations` sheet of Supplementary Data 4, analogous to
   `src/load_excalibr_calibrations.py` below. See
   [`docs/load_oddspath_calibrations.md`](docs/load_oddspath_calibrations.md).
3. **`OddsPath_classifications.ipynb`** — turns those OddsPath values into
   ACMG/AMP evidence points.
4. **`Variant_Classification_analysis.ipynb`** — combines functional
   evidence (via exCALIBR calibrations or OddsPath) with computational
   predictor evidence (REVEL, AlphaMissense, MutPred2; genome-wide and
   gene-specific), assigns final classifications, deduplicates variants
   seen in multiple assays, and exports the per-category classification
   files that become Supplementary Data 5. See
   [`notebooks/analysis/README_Variant_Classification_analysis.md`](notebooks/analysis/README_Variant_Classification_analysis.md).
5. **`src/build_variant_reclassification_dataset.py --dedup --predictor
   <REVEL|AM|MP2>`** — reads that notebook's own cell-69 checkpoint,
   re-applies its downstream exclusions, adds six ACMG/AMP points columns,
   and collapses to one row per DNA variant (greatest `abs(Combined_points)`
   wins, ties broken by `Dataset` name). Run once per computational
   predictor to produce a deduplicated reclassification dataset scored by
   each in turn (`Combined_points` is predictor-dependent, so the
   surviving measurement for a given variant can differ by predictor —
   see [`docs/build_variant_reclassification_dataset.md`](docs/build_variant_reclassification_dataset.md)).
   Produces `data/output/reclassification/integrated_variant_effect_reclassification_<REVEL|AM|MP2>.tsv.gz`.
6. **`src/build_variant_reclassification_dataset.py`** — the same script,
   default invocation: no `--dedup` (one row per surviving measurement,
   not deduplicated to one row per DNA variant — `SFPQ`, the CHEK2 QC
   flag, and unmeasured-splice/start-lost `VariantNotes` tags are still
   excluded, but bare `conflicting_fxn_data` is deliberately kept, since
   each row is one dataset's measurement) and REVEL as the default
   predictor. Produces
   `data/output/reclassification/integrated_variant_effect_biobank_input_data.tsv.gz`,
   which collaborators use for downstream biobank analysis.

Two more `src/` scripts support this stage (beyond `load_oddspath_calibrations.py`
above) and are already converted:

- **`src/load_excalibr_calibrations.py`** — loads exCALIBR JSON calibrations
  (`data/input/mave_calibration/excalibr/json/`) into Supplementary Data 4
  so the workbook stays in sync with the latest calibration run. See
  [`docs/load_excalibr_calibrations.md`](docs/load_excalibr_calibrations.md).
- **`src/mave_dataset_stats.py`** — reports summary statistics (dataset,
  measurement, and variant counts; predictor score coverage; clinical
  attribute breakdowns; ExCALIBR calibration coverage; reclassification
  agreement) over the integrated dataset. See
  [`docs/mave_dataset_stats.md`](docs/mave_dataset_stats.md).

### Running it

```bash
# One-time: build the tools image (adds the "notebooks" Poetry extra --
# ipykernel/jupyterlab -- and Arial for matplotlib; see Dockerfile)
docker compose build mave-dataset-stats

# Refresh Supplementary Data 4 from the latest exCALIBR calibrations
src/scripts/run_load_excalibr_calibrations.sh

# 1. OddsPath likelihood-ratio calculations
src/scripts/run_notebook.sh --to notebook --execute \
  --ExecutePreprocessor.kernel_name=python3 \
  --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 \
  --output executed_OddsPath_calculations.ipynb \
  notebooks/analysis/OddsPath_calculations.ipynb

# 2. Refresh Supplementary Data 4's OddsPath_calibrations sheet from that run
src/scripts/run_load_oddspath_calibrations.sh

# 3-4. Remaining notebooks above, in order
for nb in Variant_Classification_analysis OddsPath_classifications; do
  src/scripts/run_notebook.sh --to notebook --execute \
    --ExecutePreprocessor.kernel_name=python3 \
    --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 \
    --output executed_${nb}.ipynb \
    notebooks/analysis/${nb}.ipynb
done

# 5. Build a deduplicated reclassification dataset per computational predictor
for predictor in REVEL AM MP2; do
  src/scripts/run_build_variant_reclassification_dataset.sh --dedup --predictor "$predictor" \
    --output "data/output/reclassification/integrated_variant_effect_reclassification_${predictor}.tsv.gz"
done

# 6. Build the biobank-analysis reclassification export from that notebook's checkpoint
src/scripts/run_build_variant_reclassification_dataset.sh
```

Each `nbconvert --execute` leaves a side-effect `executed_<name>.ipynb` next
to the original (nbconvert's copy with outputs attached) — gitignored, so no
need to delete them. `kernel_name=python3` is `ipykernel`'s default kernel
inside the container, not a registered project-specific one — nothing in
the repo depends on a particular kernel name.

Outputs land under `data/output/supplementary_data/` (`Supplementary_Data_4.xlsx`,
`Supplementary_Data_5.xlsx`), `data/output/predictor_calibration/` (the
per-gene control files also used by Extended Data Figure 7), and
`data/output/reclassification/` (the per-predictor deduplicated
reclassification datasets from step 5, and
`integrated_variant_effect_biobank_input_data.tsv.gz`, the biobank-analysis
export from step 6).

---

## 3. Figure preparation

The third stage generates the manuscript's main and extended data figures
from Stage 2's outputs. Each figure directory under `notebooks/figures/`
contains its own plotting notebook(s)/script(s) and any small supporting
inputs.

Two toolchains are in play, depending on the figure, both Dockerized:

- **Python notebooks/scripts** (Altair/matplotlib), run via the
  `analysis-notebooks` Compose service (`jupyter nbconvert --execute`) or a
  dedicated per-script service (e.g. `build-figure3-data`) -- same tools
  image as Stage 2, no local Poetry/Jupyter setup needed.
- **R scripts/`.Rmd` files** (tidyverse, ggplot2 extensions like `ggsankey`,
  `patchwork`, `ggh4x`), run via the `r-figures` Docker Compose service
  (`Dockerfile.r`) rather than a local R install, since they depend on
  system fonts (Arial) and `cairo_pdf` output that are easiest to reproduce
  in a container.

A few figures additionally require `IGVFFI3804AVJR.csv.gz`, downloaded
separately from https://data.igvf.org/tabular-files/IGVFFI3804AVJR/ (nothing
in this repo produces it) and placed at
`data/input/biobank/IGVFFI3804AVJR.csv.gz`.

### Running it

One-time setup:

```bash
docker compose build mave-dataset-stats r-figures
```

#### Figure 2

```bash
# 1. Prep notebook (run first; everything else in this figure depends on it)
src/scripts/run_notebook.sh --to notebook --execute \

  --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 \
  --output executed_PP_ProcessBigDataFrame.ipynb \
  notebooks/figures/figure_2/PP_ProcessBigDataFrame.ipynb

# 2. Panel notebooks (independent of each other; all read step 1's output)
for nb in PP_ClinVarPrecisionRecall PP_Fig2_Heatmaps PP_ResolutionOverview PP_StackedHistograms; do
  src/scripts/run_notebook.sh --to notebook --execute \

src/scripts/run_build_figure3_data.sh

# Writes executed_curation_summary_figure3.html next to the .Rmd (gitignored)
# and PNGs/an SVG to data/output/figures/assets/figure_3/.
docker compose run --rm -w /usr/src/app/notebooks/figures/figure_3 \
  r-figures -e 'rmarkdown::render("curation_summary_figure3.Rmd", output_file = "executed_curation_summary_figure3.html")'
```

See [`docs/figures.md`](docs/figures.md#figure-3) for what each panel shows
and [`docs/build_figure3_data.md`](docs/build_figure3_data.md) for the data
pipeline behind it.

#### Figure 4

```bash
# 1. Rebuild figure4_data.json.gz, carrying forward fields that can't be
#    regenerated (see docs/build_figure4_data.md)
src/scripts/run_build_figure4_data.sh \
  --cached-json notebooks/figures/figure_4/old_figure4_data.json.gz

# 2. Execute the notebook to produce data/output/figures/assets/figure_4.png
src/scripts/run_notebook.sh --to notebook --execute \
  --ExecutePreprocessor.kernel_name=python3 \
  --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 \
  --output executed_figure4.ipynb \
  notebooks/figures/figure_4/figure4.ipynb
```

#### Figure 5/6

```bash
# Figure_6b.R -- reads data/input/biobank/IGVFFI3804AVJR.csv.gz (see above)
docker compose run --rm -w /usr/src/app/notebooks/figures/figure_5_6 \
  r-figures Figure_6b.R

# Figure5_6.Rmd: writes executed_Figure5_6.html next to the .Rmd (gitignored)
docker compose run --rm -w /usr/src/app/notebooks/figures/figure_5_6 \
  r-figures -e 'rmarkdown::render("Figure5_6.Rmd", output_file = "executed_Figure5_6.html")'

# Optional: same Figure5_6.Rmd, restricted to missense_variant rows only.
# Writes to figure_5_missense/ and figure_6_missense/ instead of
# figure_5/figure_6, so it doesn't overwrite the default run above.
docker compose run --rm -w /usr/src/app/notebooks/figures/figure_5_6 \
  r-figures -e 'rmarkdown::render("Figure5_6.Rmd", output_file = "executed_Figure5_6_missense.html", params = list(consequence_filter = "missense"))'
```

#### Extended Data Figure 4

```bash
# Extended_Data_Figure_4.R -- reads data/input/biobank/IGVFFI3804AVJR.csv.gz (see above)
docker compose run --rm -w /usr/src/app/notebooks/figures/extended_data_figure_4 \
  r-figures Extended_Data_Figure_4.R
```

#### Extended Data Figure 7

```bash
src/scripts/run_notebook.sh --to notebook --execute \
  --ExecutePreprocessor.kernel_name=python3 \
  --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 \
  --output executed_extended_data_figure_7.ipynb \
  notebooks/figures/extended_data_figure_7/Extended_Data_Figure_7.ipynb
```

#### Extended Data Figures 6, 6alt, 6alt missense, 8, 8alt, 9alt, 11, 12 (`Extended_data_figures.Rmd`)

```bash
docker compose run --rm -w /usr/src/app/notebooks/figures/extended_data_figure_6_8_9_11_12 \
  r-figures -e 'rmarkdown::render("Extended_data_figures.Rmd")'
```

#### Extended Data Figure 9 (candidate replacement for Fig. 9alt)

```bash
src/scripts/run_make_extended_data_figure_9.sh

# Optional: same chart, restricted to missense_variant rows only. Writes
# new_classification_heatmap_missense.pdf into the same
# extended_data_figure_9/ dir, so it doesn't overwrite the all-consequences
# run above.
src/scripts/run_make_extended_data_figure_9.sh --consequence-filter missense
```

OddsPath-calibrated variant, visualizing `Supplementary_Data_6.xlsx`'s
VUS/gnomAD/Unobserved sheets instead (see
[`docs/figures.md`](docs/figures.md#extended-data-figure-9-oddspath-variant-srcmake_extended_data_figure_9_oppy)):

```bash
src/scripts/run_make_extended_data_figure_9_op.sh
```

#### Extended Data Figure 10 (functional-vs-predictor evidence ablation)

```bash
src/scripts/run_ablation_variant_reclassification.sh \
  --calibrated-figure data/output/figures/assets/extended_data_figure_10/ablation.pdf

# Optional: same figure, restricted to missense-only variants. Writes to
# ablation_missense.pdf instead, so it doesn't overwrite the all-variants
# run above.
src/scripts/run_ablation_variant_reclassification.sh \
  --consequence missense_only \
  --calibrated-figure data/output/figures/assets/extended_data_figure_10/ablation_missense.pdf
```

Every `nbconvert --execute` call above leaves a side-effect `executed_<name>.ipynb`
copy next to the source, and `Figure5_6.Rmd`'s `rmarkdown::render()` call
does the same with `executed_Figure5_6.html` — both gitignored, so no need
to delete them. `Extended_data_figures.Rmd` above is the one exception: it
still renders the plain, non-gitignored `Extended_data_figures.html` next to
itself — delete that manually if you don't want it in the working tree. See
[`docs/figures.md`](docs/figures.md) for output paths for every
individual panel and several figure-specific gotchas (date-stamped
filenames, figures that only reconstruct from a cached intermediate, output
directories that aren't created automatically).

## Software Requirements

- **Docker and Docker Compose** — the only requirement to reproduce
  results. All three stages run in Docker: the variant-annotation pipeline
  and this project's own steps (Stage 1), the analysis notebooks and
  per-script figure builders (Stages 2-3, `python:3.12-slim`-based tools
  image), and the R figure scripts (Stage 3, `r-figures` service, R 4.4.2
  via `rocker/r-ver`). Neither a local Python nor R install is required.
- **Python 3.12** (optional) — only needed to develop/debug a notebook or
  script interactively outside Docker. Dependencies are Poetry-managed
  (`pyproject.toml`):
  ```bash
  poetry env use python3.12   # one-time, only if `poetry env use` picks the wrong interpreter
  poetry install --all-extras
  ```
  This creates an in-project `.venv/` with the pipeline dependencies plus
  the `dev` (Ruff, nbstripout, pre-commit), `tests` (pytest), and
  `notebooks` (JupyterLab/ipykernel) extras.
- Additional per-script package dependencies are declared in
  `pyproject.toml` (Python) or the top of each `.R`/`.Rmd` file (R).
