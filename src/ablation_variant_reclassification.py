"""Ablation analysis for the biobank-analysis reclassification method
(`src/build_variant_reclassification_dataset.py`): what does functional
evidence (ExCALIBR/OddsPath) or predictor evidence (REVEL/AlphaMissense/
MutPred2, gene-specific calibration falling back to genome-wide) accomplish
on its own, compared to the pipeline's actual combined-evidence method?

Starts from the same checkpoint file and the same downstream exclusions as
`build_variant_reclassification_dataset.py` (`apply_notebook_exclusions`),
then builds three "arms" per predictor:

- **Functional-only**: `Functional_points` alone.
- **Predictor-only**: that predictor's own `Points_<predictor>_GeneSpecific_
  GenomeWide` alone (gene-specific calibration, falling back to genome-wide,
  falling back to 0).
- **Combined**: `Functional_points + Points_<predictor>_GeneSpecific_
  GenomeWide` -- for REVEL this is exactly `build_variant_reclassification_
  dataset.py`'s own `Combined_points` column, byte-for-byte.

Since `Functional_points` doesn't depend on which predictor is active, the
functional-only arm is computed once and reused across all three predictor
sections.

**Each arm gets its own one-row-per-DNA-variant deduplication**, using that
arm's own points column via `dedup_by_max_abs_points`, rather than reusing
`build_variant_reclassification_dataset.py`'s Combined_points-based winner.
This matters: the representative assay row for a given variant can differ
between arms (e.g. one assay has the strongest functional evidence, a
different assay has the strongest REVEL evidence for the same variant), and
reusing the combined-evidence winner for a single-evidence-source arm would
silently understate what that source alone could show. This also means the
functional-only arm here is *not* a novel dedup rule: it's the same
single-pass, uniform, no-category-restriction `abs`-max-plus-`Dataset`-name-
tiebreak dedup `build_variant_reclassification_dataset.py` already uses for
its combined arm, just keyed on `Functional_points` instead of
`Combined_points` -- which also happens to match the *notebook's own*
dedup key (`Fxn_points`) for its category-specific `VUS`/`gnomAD`/
`Unobserved`/`controls`/`ClinGen_Repo` outputs (see
`docs/variant_classification.md`), even though the notebook's dedup is
otherwise more elaborate (nt/aa resolution preference, category splits) than
this script's single uniform pass.

Each arm is classified pathogenic-or-benign vs. uncertain using the same
fixed point cutoffs as the rest of this pipeline
(`points_are_pathogenic_or_benign`, from `src/mave_dataset_stats.py`: >=6 or
<=-1 total points), and summarized the same way as `mave_dataset_stats.py`'s
reclassification-export section: how many distinct DNA variants are
pathogenic-or-benign, how many ClinVar VUS are resolved, how many unobserved
(SNV) variants are resolved.

Finally, for each predictor, a three-way agree/disagree contingency table
(functional-only vs. predictor-only vs. combined, each resolved in
`--direction` or not) is reported twice: once over every variant, and once
restricted to a configurable scope of variant categories (`--scope`,
repeatable; default `vus`+`unobserved`, matching this pipeline's headline
claim):

- `vus`/`gnomad`/`unobserved` -- ClinVar VUS, gnomAD population variants, and
  unobserved variants, the previously-uncertain populations the pipeline's
  headline claim is about.
- `clinvar_control`/`clingen_control` -- ClinVar or ClinGen Evidence
  Repository *control* variants (already-known-truth calibration variants,
  reproducing `Variant_Classification_analysis.ipynb`'s own `controls`/
  `clingen` category membership filters -- see `is_clinvar_control`/
  `is_clingen_control`), for checking each arm's agreement with a known
  answer rather than counting newly-resolved uncertain variants. Not part of
  the default scope -- pass explicitly.
- `clinvar_control_missense_only`/`clingen_control_missense_only` -- the
  same two control populations, restricted to strictly missense variants
  (`is_missense_only`, i.e. `condensed_consequence == "missense_variant"`,
  excluding start-loss) -- one of the two consequence types REVEL/
  AlphaMissense/MutPred2 actually score, so the predictor-only and combined
  arms are a meaningful comparison rather than diluted by consequence types
  no predictor ever scores. Also not part of the default scope. (Not to be
  confused with `--consequence missense_only`, which restricts the *entire*
  analysis this way -- see below.)

The second table isolates how many of that scope's variants get resolved (in
`--direction`; default `any`, either direction -- pass `pathogenic` or
`benign` to restrict the contingency table/chart to just Pathogenic/Likely
Pathogenic or just Benign/Likely Benign outcomes), and in particular how many
are resolved by *combining* evidence but not by either source alone (true
synergy, not just one source doing all the work). Restricting `--direction`
also reshapes what counts as the "lost to combining" conflict bucket/chart
bar: with `--direction pathogenic`, it becomes variants a single arm alone
already classified Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic *before* combining evidence
pulled the combined score back out of that range (into Uncertain, or even
across to Benign-leaning) -- not just any-direction sign conflicts.

Usage: `python -m src.ablation_variant_reclassification [checkpoint_file]
[--chek2-file path] [--consequence all|missense|missense_only]
[--predictor REVEL] [--predictor AlphaMissense] [--scope vus]
[--scope gnomad] [--scope unobserved] [--scope clinvar_control]
[--scope clingen_control] [--scope clinvar_control_missense_only]
[--scope clingen_control_missense_only]
[--direction any|pathogenic|benign] [--output path]
[--plot path] [--plot-comparison path] [--plot-redundant-gain path]
[--document path] [--document-chart ablation] [--document-split-dir dir]
[--document-split-format pdf|png|svg]`.
`--consequence missense` restricts the entire analysis -- every arm, scope,
direction, chart, and document section, not just the `*_missense_only`
scopes -- to missense/start-loss variants (`is_missense_or_start_loss`), the
only two consequence types REVEL/AlphaMissense/MutPred2 actually score;
`--consequence missense_only` restricts it further, to strictly
`condensed_consequence == "missense_variant"` (excluding start-loss, see
`is_missense_only` -- the same function the `*_missense_only` `--scope`
values use, but applied to the whole analysis rather than just those two
control scopes); omitting it (`all`, the default) applies no restriction.
`--predictor` is repeatable; omitting it runs all three.
`--scope` is repeatable; omitting it defaults to `vus`+`unobserved`.
`--direction` is single-select; omitting it defaults to `any`. `--plot`
renders the "added value of combining evidence" chart (one stacked bar per
predictor, restricted to the same scope/direction -- see
`build_predictor_section`/`save_synergy_chart`) to an image file (format
inferred from the extension, e.g. `.png`/`.svg`/`.pdf`). `--plot-comparison`
renders that same chart for Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic and Benign/Likely
Benign side by side in one image, independently of `--direction` (see
`build_direction_comparison_chart_data`/`save_synergy_chart_comparison`).
`--plot-redundant-gain` drills into `--plot`'s "Each alone sufficient
(redundant)" band: a histogram, per predictor, of how many points combining
added on top of each single already-sufficient source (see
`build_redundant_gain_chart_data`/`save_redundant_gain_chart`).
`--document-split-dir` writes `--document`'s per-section chart blocks out as
separate files (one per chart-type/scope pair, each already carrying its own
legend) instead of one combined multi-section image -- see
`save_document_charts_as_files` and Extended Data Figure 10 in
`docs/figures.md`.

    This script's own `dedup_by_max_abs_points` (used everywhere else, via

    amino-acid change and therefore one shared amino-acid-level functional/
    predictor measurement, which a coordinate-only dedup would otherwise
    let each of those NT variants independently claim as if it were unique
    supporting evidence, inflating control-population counts.

    Two branches, split by `nucleotide_or_aa`:

    - **nt branch**: rows with a direct, NT-resolution measurement.
      Collapse exact-coordinate duplicates by `VariantNotes` tag order
      (same tie-break as `dedup_vus_gnomad_unobserved`'s `"v1"` strategy),
      then -- ClinVar only -- keep only 1+-star review-status rows
      (`ONE_PLUS_STAR_VALUES`).
    - **aa branch**: rows whose evidence only resolves to a shared
      amino-acid change (`AA_GROUP_COLS`). ClinVar only: drop any
      amino-acid group whose ClinVar review-status membership conflicts
      across its rows (`summarize_clinvar_star_group`) -- a group can't be
      trusted as a control when its own members disagree this sharply on
      review confidence. Then, restricted to rows already flagged as both
      the shared functional maximum (`VariantNotes == "max_fxn_pts"`) *and*
      `predictor`'s own per-variant maximum (`GeneSpecific_<predictor>_max
      == "max_pred_pts"`), resolve which single NT variant represents each
      remaining amino-acid group (`aa_dedup_or_mark`, `controls_aa_sort_
      key`/`clingen_aa_sort_key`) -- ClinVar prefers the highest-confidence,
      most-recently-reviewed record; ClinGen prefers the non-retracted,
      most-recently-approved/published record. Under `"nt_then_abs_max"`,
      `aa_dedup_or_mark` itself keeps every candidate, tagged `Variant_Role`
      "primary" (the chosen representative) or "secondary" -- this function
      then keeps only "primary" rows, matching the canonical, distributed
      `Supplementary_Data_5.xlsx` exactly (confirmed directly: 12,433 rows
      on `controls_REVEL_GeneSpecific` on the real dataset, vs. 23,322 in
      the separate `Supplementary_Data_5.with_secondary_variants.xlsx`
      export, which keeps every "secondary" row too) -- this is the actual
      double-counting guard: each amino-acid group contributes exactly one
      representative row, not one per constituent NT variant.

    The two branches are concatenated, `predictor`'s own training variants
    excluded (`PREDICTOR_TRAIN_AMINO_COLUMNS` -- no exclusion for
    AlphaMissense, matching the notebook), and finally `catch_mis_2`
    resolves the remaining case where the nt branch's own survivor and the
    aa branch's chosen representative land on the *exact same* genomic
    coordinate (an nt-resolution record always wins over an aa-resolution
    one for the same variant, under `"nt_then_abs_max"`).

    Returns a DataFrame with one row per surviving DNA variant, carrying
    `Functional_points`/that predictor's own points column/its combined
    points column (`add_ablation_points_columns` already added these
    upstream, unaffected by which dedup path a row survives through).

    `max_scopes_per_row` at a given `page_width` (more width per scope) is

    within each bar, labels are sorted bottom-to-top and partitioned into

    closer together than a label needs. When that happens, the same
    cluster re-tries with two more columns just outside the bar (`+- bar_

    outside-right, four distinct columns in top-to-bottom sort order, one
    label per column, so nothing needs to share a column at all. (An
    outside column risks reaching a neighboring bar in general -- the
    reason an earlier version confined everything to inside-only columns
    -- but this whole function is opted into by exactly one chart, and on
