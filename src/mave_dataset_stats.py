"""Summary statistics for the integrated MAVE variant effect dataset.

Reads the condensed variant effect dataset (one row per variant effect
measurement/score; see data/output/maves/integrated_variant_effect_dataset*.tsv.gz)
together with its dataset-level metadata (Supplementary_Data_3.xlsx) and
reports, for three groupings of datasets -- IGVF-produced only, non-IGVF
("community") only, and combined -- the number of datasets, variant effect
measurements, RNA scores, composite scores, distinct variants assayed, and
genes represented. The IGVF-produced grouping is additionally broken out into
"IGVF SGE" and "IGVF VAMP-seq" sub-rows -- the latter covering
`IGVF_VAMP_SEQ_DATASETS` (G6PD_IGVF, TSC2_IGVF, and all six F9_Popp_2025_*
datasets), the former every other IGVF-produced dataset -- immediately below
the "IGVF" row. `rna_scores` is a breakdown of `variant_effect_measurements`
(every row with a non-empty `rna_score` also carries a regular
`auth_reported_score`), not an addition to it, reported beside it for
visibility. Distinct variants assayed is reported three ways: distinct
protein variants assayed directly (distinct `hgvs_p` among rows reported at
protein resolution, `nucleotide_or_aa == "aa"`), distinct DNA variants
assayed directly (distinct `hgvs_c` among rows reported at DNA resolution,
`nucleotide_or_aa == "nt"`), and the total distinct (`hgvs_c`, `hgvs_p`)
pairs across all rows regardless of resolution -- see `compute_bucket_stats`.
Each bucket's variant effect measurements are also reported as a percentage
of the combined total (100% for the combined row), both on their own
(`pct_variant_effect_measurements`) and combined with RNA scores
(`pct_variant_effect_measurements_with_rna_scores`, out of the combined total
of measurements plus RNA scores). Immediately after that table, a "Genes
represented" section lists which genes are covered only by IGVF datasets,
only by non-IGVF ("community") datasets, or by both. CALM1/CALM2/CALM3 are
always counted and listed as a single "CALM1/2/3" gene, both in this table's
`genes_represented`/`genes_not_in_igvf_data` counts and in the "Genes
represented" list below, since treating the same calmodulin target as three
separate genes isn't useful.

Next, an "IGVF-produced datasets" table breaks the Dataset summary's IGVF
`variant_effect_measurements`, `rna_scores`, and `composite_scores` counts out
per dataset -- one row per IGVF-produced dataset, sorted by
`variant_effect_measurements` descending -- see
`compute_igvf_dataset_measurement_counts`.

It additionally reports, in a set of text tables, how many variants and
variant measurements have REVEL, AlphaMissense, and MutPred2 scores, and how
many fall into each of several clinical-attribute buckets (ClinVar VUS,
ClinVar pathogenic/benign, observed in gnomAD, or none of the above), using
ClinVar 2025 for every gene except BRCA1, PTEN, MSH2, and TP53, which use
ClinVar 2018 instead. This is reported four ways: at the assayed-variant
(protein-resolution, from the condensed file) or DNA-variant (from the
expanded file) level, and as distinct variants or as variant measurements
(i.e. rows). Each clinical-attribute table also carries
two extra columns breaking out, for each of the four buckets, how many of the
level's SNVs are in it (or, at the assayed-variant level, "SNV-accessible"
variants: those with at least one single-nucleotide-substitution candidate
among the DNA-level changes -- `hgvs_c`/`transcript_ref`/`transcript_alt` --
that reverse-translate to that protein change), as a percentage of the
level's total SNV(-accessible) count (also given in that table's totals
line).

By default, a variant with a conflicting or ambiguous ClinVar call --
disagreement between a pathogenic-leaning and benign-leaning classification
across its measurements/DNA candidates, or ClinVar's own "Conflicting
classifications of pathogenicity" call -- is excluded from both the VUS and
pathogenic-or-benign buckets and counted in its own "ClinVar conflict" bucket
instead, mirroring the conflict handling in
Analysis/Curation_summary_V5_cleaned.ipynb. Pass `--allow-clinvar-conflicts`
to instead fold such variants into VUS/pathogenic-or-benign via any-match
(the original behavior), which also drops the conflict bucket from the
report.

A dataset counts as "IGVF-produced" if Supplementary_Data_3's Curation sheet
marks its `IGVF Produced?` column "Yes". A row counts as a direct measurement
if its dataset's `Primary Score Set or Meta-analysis?` column reads "primary
score set"; everything else (meta-analyses, trained predictors, etc.) counts
as a composite score. This is a per-dataset determination: every row of a
given dataset is classified the same way.

Note on `(hgvs_g, hgvs_p)`: the integrated dataset has no `hgvs_g` (genomic
HGVS) column -- its DNA-level identifier is `hgvs_c` (transcript-relative
HGVS, pipe-delimited when a protein-resolution measurement corresponds to more
than one underlying DNA change). This script uses `hgvs_c` as that DNA-level
key, so "distinct variants assayed" counts distinct (hgvs_c, hgvs_p) pairs in
the condensed file.

Note on pipe-delimited annotation columns (REVEL, AM_score, MutPred2,
clinvar_sig_2025, gnomad_MAF): in the condensed file these follow the same
one-part-per-underlying-DNA-change convention as `hgvs_c`, and the parts don't
always agree (e.g. one DNA-level candidate has a REVEL score and another
doesn't). An assayed variant (or measurement row) counts as having a value, or
matching a target ClinVar significance, if *any* one of its pipe-delimited
parts does. In the expanded (DNA-variant-level) file there's only ever one
part, so this reduces to a plain presence/absence check there. "Observed in
gnomAD" follows this repo's existing convention elsewhere (see
notebooks/analysis/README_OddsPath_classifications.md) of treating any non-empty
`gnomad_MAF` as observed, regardless of the allele count.

The Dataset summary and Genes represented sections above always count
CALM1/CALM2/CALM3 as one gene target (see above). Elsewhere in the report --
the Meta-analyses gene column and the ExCALIBR calibration coverage section --
they're also merged into one gene target by default, since they encode the
same calmodulin protein; pass `--no-merge-calm-genes` to count them as three
separate genes there instead, matching how the underlying data labels them.

Two further sections cover ExCALIBR calibration coverage and reclassification
agreement, sourced from `--excalibr-calibrations-file` (default
Supplementary_Data_4.xlsx) and `--controls-file` (default
Supplementary_Data_5.xlsx) respectively:

- **ExCALIBR calibration coverage** (Extended Data Figure 4): how many genes
  have a row in Supplementary_Data_4's `ExCALIBR_calibrations` sheet, and how
  many of those genes have at least one dataset where ExCALIBR assigned at
  least one point of evidence in either direction (i.e. at least one of that
  row's `range_-8`..`range_8` columns is non-null). That sheet's `dataset`
  values are matched against this script's own dataset metadata (the same
  `Dataset Name` -> `Gene` mapping used elsewhere) to determine gene
  membership, after stripping a trailing `_clinvar_2018` suffix (this sheet's
  convention for marking a mixed-year duplicate calibration of the same
  dataset) and Unicode-normalizing (NFC) both sides, since accented
  characters can round-trip through Excel in different composed/decomposed
  forms across files. Any `dataset` value that still doesn't resolve raises
  `ValueError`, same as an unrecognized dataset in the main metadata file.

- **ClinGen Evidence Repository control set**: how many DNA variants have a
  determinate original ClinGen classification (`Assertion_ClinGen_repo`) and
  MAVE experimental data (after the same checkpoint-downstream exclusions as
  the filter funnel above, minus its training-variant split); how many
  distinct DNA variants from that same MAVE-experimental-data population --
  regardless of their *original* ClinGen classification -- have a
  determinate classification after
  `src/recalculate_clingen_classification.py` recomputes it with functional
  (BS3/PS3) and predictive (BP4/PP3) evidence removed
  (`Updated_Classification_ClinGen_repo`), including a breakout of how many
  of those were originally Uncertain Significance in ClinGen (matching the
  population gate `Variant_Classification_analysis.ipynb` actually uses --
  see `compute_clingen_evidence_repository_stats`'s docstring); and how many
  are ultimately retained per predictor (the `ClinGen_Repo_*_GeneSpecific`
  sheets, after also excluding that predictor's own training variants and
  deduplicating amino-acid-resolution variants to a representative DNA
  variant -- these three totals are also each `Control concordance`'s
  "ClinGen" `Total` above). See `compute_clingen_evidence_repository_stats`.

- **Reclassification agreement** (Figure 4c): for every sheet in the controls
  file whose name starts with `controls_` (one per predictor/calibration
  combination -- REVEL, AlphaMissense, MutPred2 -- which should agree with
  each other since this doesn't depend on which predictor is active), how
  often ExCALIBR's evidence assignment (`ExC_points_2025`) and the functional
  class assignment (`OP_points`) agree with the row's ClinVar
  pathogenic-or-benign control label (`clnsig_group_18_25`). A row's points
  column is treated as assigning pathogenic evidence if positive, benign
  evidence if negative, and no evidence if zero or missing -- rows with no
  evidence assigned are excluded from the agreement percentage (reported
  separately as "no point of evidence assigned") but still counted in the
  section's total.

- **Control concordance**: for the ClinVar (`controls_*_GeneSpecific`) and
  ClinGen Evidence Repository (`ClinGen_Repo_*_GeneSpecific`) control sets
  separately, how many variants (and what percent) are concordant,
  discordant, or classified VUS -- once for OddsPath calibration evidence
  alone (`OP_points` sign, read once from the REVEL sheet since functional
  evidence is shared across predictors), once each for the combined
  ExCALIBR/OddsPath + REVEL/AlphaMissense/MutPred2 gene-specific evidence
  (`Class_REVEL`/`Class_AM`/`Class_MP2`, each from that predictor's own
  Supplementary Data 5 sheet, combining the pipeline's actual "Current"
  per-gene functional-evidence pick -- ExCALIBR for most genes, OddsPath for
  F9/TP53 -- with that predictor's gene-specific calibration falling back to
  genome-wide), and, immediately after each predictor's gene-specific row,
  once more for that predictor's OddsPath + universal calibration
  (`Class_OP_REVEL`/`Class_OP_AM`/`Class_OP_MP2`, each from that predictor's
  own Supplementary Data 6 `{controls,ClinGen_Repo}_*_OP` sheet) -- unlike the
  gene-specific row, this combines OddsPath functional evidence unconditionally
  (not the ExCALIBR/OddsPath "Current" per-gene pick) with that predictor's
  genome-wide-only ("universal") calibration, with no gene-specific fallback --
  see `docs/conflicting_evidence_concordance.md`'s `OddsPath`/`Universal` axis
  definitions. Rendered as one table per control source with a row per
  evidence source so all seven can be compared at a glance. Discordant is
  further broken out by direction: control
  Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic reclassified Benign/Likely Benign by the
  evidence source, vs. the reverse -- the two sum to the Discordant count.
  ClinVar's control label is `clnsig_group_18_25`; ClinGen's is
  `Updated_Classification_ClinGen_repo` (its own assertion, since
  `clnsig_group_18_25` isn't a clean ClinVar label for ClinGen-only
  controls). The ClinGen table additionally reports each row's `Genes`
  (distinct genes among that row's in-scope ClinGen control variants) and
  its `PLP`/`BLB` population split (ClinGen's own classification alone,
  independent of the evidence source, summing to `Total`) -- not shown for
  ClinVar, whose much larger control set doesn't need per-row gene/PLP-BLB
  counts called out. See `compute_control_concordance`.

  Immediately after that table, a second, missense-only table repeats the
  same breakdown -- ClinVar and ClinGen subsections alike, including
  ClinGen's `Genes`/`PLP`/`BLB` columns -- restricted to
  `simplified_consequence == "missense_variant"` rows before scoring --
  see `MISSENSE_CONTROL_CONCORDANCE_SOURCES`/`MISSENSE_CONSEQUENCE_VALUE`.

- **Variant classification**: how many distinct DNA variants have a
  classification, how many of those are pathogenic or benign, and how many
  ClinVar VUS / unobserved variants are "resolved" -- reclassified/classified
  pathogenic or benign -- and what percent of that category that is, further
  split into how many (and what percent of the category) are
  Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic vs. Benign/Likely Benign, and, of the
  Benign/Likely Benign side, how many (and what percent) have only the
  minimum possible evidence, -1 point: (re)classification of DNA variants
  using functional evidence points (ExCALIBR for most genes, OddsPath for
  F9/TP53 -- see `docs/variant_classification.md`) plus REVEL predictor
  evidence, gene-specific calibration falling back to genome-wide, from the
  controls file's `controls_REVEL_GeneSpecific`, `ClinGen_Repo_REVEL_GeneSpecific`,
  `VUS_REVEL`, `gnomAD_REVEL`, and `Unobserved_REVEL` sheets' precomputed
  `Class_REVEL` column, deduplicated to one row per distinct DNA variant
  (`VARIANT_CLASSIFICATION_COORD_COLS`) -- restricted to variants falling
  into one of those five categories, and (for `controls`/`ClinGen_Repo`)
  deduplicated by that category's own DNA-resolution-preferred rule (see
  `docs/variant_classification.md#decided-approach`).

Immediately after that section, a "Chi-squared tests" section reports, for each predictor, whether the
Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic and Benign/Likely Benign rates cited in the
manuscript's Fig. 6d/e paragraphs actually differ between gnomAD, ClinVar
VUS, and Unobserved variants: gnomAD vs. ClinVar VUS (Pathogenic/Likely
Pathogenic rate and, separately, Benign/Likely Benign rate), and Unobserved
vs. ClinVar VUS and vs. gnomAD (Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic rate only, the
two comparisons the manuscript draws for the Unobserved category). Each
comparison is a 2x2 Pearson's chi-squared test of independence with Yates'
continuity correction (R's `chisq.test()` default for a 2x2 table,
equivalent to `prop.test(..., correct = TRUE)`) between the two groups'
raw counts/totals from the Supplementary Data 5 version's own
`{category}_total`/`{category}_resolved_pathogenic`/`{category}_resolved_
benign` stats -- the rate over the full category, not just the "resolved"
(pathogenic-or-benign) subset. See
`compute_variant_classification_chi_squared_tests`.

A final section, "Gene-level discordance", reports the genes with the most
control variants where the ExCALIBR/OddsPath + REVEL gene-specific
classification (`Class_REVEL`, from the controls file's
`controls_REVEL_GeneSpecific` sheet, deduplicated to one row per distinct DNA
variant) disagrees with the row's ClinVar pathogenic-or-benign control label
(`clnsig_group_18_25`) -- i.e. calls a ClinVar Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic
control Benign/Likely benign, or vice versa. It shows the top 5 genes by
total discordant-variant count, each broken down by direction of discordance
(ClinVar P/LP reclassified B/LB, vs. ClinVar B/LB reclassified P/LP). See
`compute_gene_discordance_stats`.

A "Simplified consequence x SpliceAI score breakdown" section reports, for
each of the five Supplementary Data 5 variant categories (from the same
REVEL sheets as the Supplementary Data 5 variant classification section --
`controls_REVEL_GeneSpecific`, `ClinGen_Repo_REVEL_GeneSpecific`,
`VUS_REVEL`, `gnomAD_REVEL`, and `Unobserved_REVEL`, each deduplicated to
one row per distinct DNA variant the same way), a table with one row per
`simplified_consequence` value and one column per category, each cell
showing that consequence/category combination's distinct DNA variant count
split two ways: those with every SpliceAI delta score (`spliceAI_DS_AG`,
`spliceAI_DS_AL`, `spliceAI_DS_DG`, `spliceAI_DS_DL`) null or below 0.2, and
those with at least one of those four scores at or above 0.2. See
`compute_consequence_splice_breakdown`.

Both file arguments are optional and default to the paths above. Output is
written as plain text (to stdout, and optionally to `--output` as well).

A "Filtering effects on the reclassification dataset" section, immediately
after the ExCALIBR calibration coverage section, shows a sequential funnel:
starting from every DNA-level measurement row in the expanded file, it applies
-- in the pipeline's actual order -- every exclusion
`Variant_Classification_analysis.ipynb` and `src/build_variant_reclassification_dataset.py`
apply before a variant reaches the reclassification export, reporting each
step's effect two ways: distinct DNA variants (the reclassification
pipeline's own dedup key, `Gene`/`Chrom`/
`hg38_start`/`ref_allele`/`alt_allele`) and distinct assayed variants (each
row's `mavedb_variant_urn` mapped back to its parent condensed-file row's
`(hgvs_c, hgvs_p)` pair -- the same key `distinct_variants_assayed` uses, so
this matches that figure exactly over the unfiltered file -- an assayed
variant is only counted as filtered out once every one of its DNA-level
candidates has been). See `compute_reclassification_filter_funnel`'s
docstring for the exact steps and `--checkpoint-file`/`--chek2-file` for the
two extra inputs this section needs.

    """Sequential funnel from every DNA-level measurement row in the expanded
    file down to the reclassification export, applying each exclusion in the
    pipeline's actual order and recording distinct-DNA-variant and
    distinct-assayed-variant counts after each step.

    Step 1 (F9/TP53 restricted datasets) is `Variant_Classification_
    analysis.ipynb` cell 40, reproduced against `expanded` since it's what
    produces `checkpoint` in the first place. LDLR's LA-module exclusion is
    no longer a pre-checkpoint row-drop -- it's a `Flag == '*'` set by
    `flag_variants.py` upstream of `expanded` itself, so those rows survive
    into `checkpoint` (still present, just flagged) and are only removed
    later, folded into the "Other flagged variants" step below alongside any
    other pre-existing flag. The remaining steps mirror
    `src.build_variant_reclassification_dataset.apply_notebook_exclusions`,
    split into named sub-steps: Flag=='*' removal is split into the CHEK2
    QC flag specifically vs. any other pre-existing flag, since the notebook
    sets the former (`Filter_CI == 1`) immediately before removing all
    flagged rows together; and the single `VariantNotes`-tag exclusion is
    split into its three underlying tags (`CONFLICTING_FXN_DATA_TAG`/
    `SPLICE_VARIANT_NOT_MEASURED_TAG`/`START_LOST_VARIANT_NOT_MEASURED_TAG`),
    applied in that order so a combined-tag row (e.g. both conflicting and
    splice-related) is removed at whichever of its tags' steps comes first.
    The `splice_var_amino`-based step exempts rows from a splice-aware
    dataset (`SPLICE_MEASURE_COL == SPLICE_MEASURE_VALUE`), matching
    `apply_notebook_exclusions`'s own exemption -- `SPLICE_VARIANT_NOT_
    MEASURED_TAG` needs no matching exemption here, since the notebook
    folds the same check into that tag's own computation upstream of
    `checkpoint`.

    A "distinct assayed variant" is *not* a distinct `mavedb_variant_urn`:
    that identifies one MaveDB score-set record (one per dataset), so the
    same variant assayed by two datasets would count twice. Instead, since
    `mavedb_variant_urn` is 1:1 with `condensed`'s rows, each expanded/
    checkpoint row's urn is mapped back to its parent condensed row's
    `VARIANT_KEY_COLS` (`hgvs_c`, `hgvs_p`) pair -- the same key
    `distinct_variants_assayed` uses -- and distinct *pairs* are counted.
    This reproduces `distinct_variants_assayed` exactly over the unfiltered
    file: splitting by `nucleotide_or_aa` instead (distinct `hgvs_p` for `aa`
    rows plus distinct `hgvs_c` for `nt` rows) overcounts by the number of
    variants assayed at *both* resolutions -- an `aa`-side reverse-translation
    candidate that happens to equal some `nt`-side row's exact `hgvs_c` for
    the same `hgvs_p` (535 such variants in the full dataset) -- since that
    split double-counts them instead of merging them the way the
    `(hgvs_c, hgvs_p)` pair key naturally does.

    The REVEL- and MutPred2-training exclusions (the last two steps) are
    siblings, not a chain: both filter the same "Other flagged variants"
    survivor set independently -- see `REVEL_TRAINING_STEP_LABEL`/
    `MUTPRED2_TRAINING_STEP_LABEL`. Each step's `*_removed` fields are the
    drop from its own logical predecessor (that survivor set, for both of
    these two), not necessarily from whichever step precedes it in the
    returned list.

    Returns a list of `{"label", "rows", "rows_removed",
    "variant_effect_measurements", "measurements_removed",
    "distinct_dna_variants", "dna_removed", "distinct_assayed_variants",
    "assayed_removed"}` dicts, one per step (including two leading rows over
    the unfiltered expanded file -- see below -- whose `*_removed` fields are
    all 0 except the second's `measurements_removed`).
    `variant_effect_measurements` is `mavedb_variant_urn`'s distinct-value
    count -- the same measurement-level count as
    `integrated_variant_effect_dataset.condensed.tsv`'s row count (`urn` is
    1:1 with `condensed`'s rows), reached here by grouping the expanded/
    checkpoint file's (possibly several per measurement, e.g. multiple
    DNA-level candidates for one protein-resolution measurement) rows by
    their shared `urn` -- unlike `rows`, which counts those DNA-level rows
    directly without collapsing by `urn`.

    The funnel starts with two rows over the same unfiltered `expanded`
    file, both with identical `rows`/`distinct_dna_variants`/
    `distinct_assayed_variants`: the first, "including RNA scores", counts
    every `rna_score`-bearing measurement as an *additional* measurement on
    top of `variant_effect_measurements`'s usual one-per-urn count (unlike
    the Dataset summary's `rna_scores`, which is a breakdown of that count,
    not an addition to it -- see `compute_bucket_stats`); the second,
    "- RNA scores", drops back to the plain one-per-urn count used by every
    later step, so its `measurements_removed` is exactly that RNA-score
    measurement count.

    predictor evidence from REVEL, AlphaMissense, and MutPred2, each gene-
    specific calibration falling back to genome-wide) across the five
    Supplementary_Data_5 variant categories, for each predictor.

    For each predictor, reads that predictor's own category sheets
    (`VARIANT_CLASSIFICATION_CATEGORY_SHEETS_BY_PREDICTOR`) from `workbook`
    and reports:

    - Across every category combined (a variant appearing in more than one
      category's sheet -- e.g. a ClinVar control also observed in gnomAD --
      is counted once): how many distinct DNA variants have a `Class_*`
      classification, and how many of those are Pathogenic/Likely
      Pathogenic/Benign/Likely Benign rather than Uncertain.
    - Within `VUS` alone: how many ClinVar Uncertain-significance variants
      are "resolved" -- reclassified Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic/Benign/
      Likely Benign by this pipeline -- and what percent of VUS that is, plus
      how many (and what percent) of VUS land on each side (Pathogenic/Likely
      Pathogenic vs. Benign/Likely Benign). Each side is further split by
      which evidence source(s) contributed a nonzero value (`Fxn_points` for
      experimental, the predictor's own gene-specific/genome-wide points for
      predictive): only experimental, only predictive, or both -- mutually
      exclusive and exhaustive for any resolved (nonzero-total) row, since a
      zero total (both sides zero, or opposite-sign values that cancel to
      zero) always falls in the Uncertain range instead. Separately, the
      Benign/Likely Benign side reports how many have only the minimum
      possible evidence (`Total_Points_* == LIKELY_BENIGN_POINTS_THRESHOLD`,
      i.e. -1 point), further split into how many of *those* got there from
      only one evidence source (`Fxn_points == 0` or the predictor's own
      points are 0 -- the other side contributed nothing) vs. from
      conflicting functional-vs-predictor evidence (`Conflicting_* ==
      CONFLICTING_EVIDENCE_VALUE`, i.e. the two sides disagreed in sign but
      still summed to -1). At exactly -1 point these two are mutually
      exclusive and exhaustive: `Total_Points_* == Fxn_points +
      Points_*_GeneSpecific_GenomeWide`, and two same-signed nonzero terms
      can't sum to a magnitude-1 total, so every -1-point row is either
      single-source or conflicting, never both or neither.
      Separately, `VUS` also reports how many variants are "unresolved" --
      still `Uncertain` after this pipeline -- and what percent of VUS that
      is, further split by the same evidence-source combination used above,
      with the "both" case itself split by sign agreement (`Conflicting_* ==
      CONFLICTING_EVIDENCE_VALUE`): concordant (both present, same sign),
      discordant (both present, opposite signs -- i.e. `Conflicting_*`
      flagged this row, but the evidence still summed to something in the
      Uncertain range), experimental only, predictive only, or neither --
      mutually exclusive and exhaustive over the unresolved rows -- plus a
      combined "zero or one source" total (experimental-only + predictive-
      only + neither, i.e. everything except concordant/discordant). Each of
      these is reported as a percent of the *unresolved* count, not of
      `vus_total`. Also reports how many unresolved rows have
      `Total_Points_* in NEAR_PATHOGENIC_POINTS_VALUES` (4 or 5) -- the
      strongest possible Uncertain calls, one or two points short of
      resolving Likely Pathogenic. This overlaps the other unresolved
      columns (a near-pathogenic row can be concordant, discordant,
      experimental-only, or predictive-only, and so also counts toward
      "zero or one source" when it's experimental-only or predictive-only)
      rather than adding a sixth mutually-exclusive bucket. It can never be
      "neither", since a zero-zero split always totals 0 points, not 4 or 5.
    - Within `gnomAD` alone (population variants with a `gnomad_MAF` value,
      per `notebooks/analysis/README_Variant_Classification_analysis.md` --
      not necessarily lacking a ClinVar call, so this can overlap `VUS`) and
      within `Unobserved` alone (variants absent from both ClinVar and
      gnomAD): the same resolved count/percent, P/LP vs. B/LB split (with
      its experimental/predictive/both evidence-source split), minimum-
      evidence B/LB count (with its single-source vs. conflicting split),
      and unresolved count/percent (with its own concordant/discordant/
      experimental-only/predictive-only/neither split, plus the near-
      pathogenic overlap), computed exactly the same way as `VUS` above.

    Both category-specific counts are computed over each category's own
    distinct DNA variants, independent of the cross-category dedup used for
    the combined total above. Each predictor's population differs slightly
    from the others' (each sheet excludes only *that* predictor's own
    training variants), so totals are not expected to match across
    predictors.

    Returns `{predictor: stats}` for `predictor` in
